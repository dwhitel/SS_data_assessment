# Subsurface Data Assessment
##### Data science assessment for subsurface data scientist/engineering candidates.

The assessment is designed to demonstrate your experience working with oil and gas data and building machine learning models with actual data.  There are two parts to this assignment.  For [Part 1](notebooks/Part1-Data.ipynb), you will be working with standard industry data files and do some visualization and analysis.  For [Part 2](notebooks/Part2-Modeling.ipynb), you will be given a Jupyter notebook with a simple machine learning workflow that builds a model to predict production from a set of wells.  You can investigate and improve upon this model.

As you are working through these tasks, think about how you would present and discuss the result.  After you complete the assignment, you'll give a short presentation.  The presentation should guide us through what you did, any observations or ideas you had.  We may ask questions about your approach, the technology you used and insights you have.   

If you have any questions or need any clarification, please contact Brendon at <brendon.hall@petro.ai>.
